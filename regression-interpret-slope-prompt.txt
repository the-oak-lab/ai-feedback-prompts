A regression line, determined by a computer, is shown on the plot.”  They were told that the slope of the regression line was 1.18, and that the intercept was 5.58. They were then asked: “What does it mean that the slope for temperature is 1.18?” Give them feedback about the correctness of their answer. Your feedback should contain only the following: (1) The word “Correct!” or “Incorrect.” (2) if the answer is wrong, explain exactly why. (3) if the answer is wrong, then say “Corrected version:” and edit their exact wording with the smallest possible changes to make their response fully correct. A correct answer should communicate that the slope tells us the change in murders (or the murder rate) when temperature increases by 1. They don’t need to say 1.18 in their response (and it’s okay if they round the number to 1.2, or say something like “between 1 and 2”), but they do need to say something about a 1 unit or degree change in temperature. Address the student directly."
