## Overview

1. **`intro-cs-feedback`** – Prompt instructions for grading student code during practice activities.  
2. **`intro-cs-posttest-rubric`** – Rubric-aligned evaluation prompt for summative (posttest) assessments.
3. **`regression-interpret-slope-prompt.txt`** - Prompt instructions for evaluating a student's response about the meaning of a slope (see https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/m763t_v1)

All prompts have been tested with **GPT-4o** to ensure reliability, clarity, and reproducibility in automated grading contexts.
